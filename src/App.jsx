            Iâ€™m currently a 2nd year computer science student. My interests include robotics, deep learning, machine learning, math, and software engineering, and low level engineering. <strong>My goal for the next decade is to solve the problem of the world using my engineering and programming skills.</strong> While making some money for myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last summer, I was doing full-stack development as an freelancer. The summer before that, I was fine-tuning large language models.
          </p>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m currently looking for opportunities in web dev, robotics, deep learning, and/or software engineering for Fall 2025. Feel free to contact me via email <strong>(divyanshtwork@gmail.com)</strong> or any of the links below.
