            Iâ€™m currently a 2nd year computer science student. My interests
            include robotics, deep learning, machine learning, math, software
            engineering, and low level engineering. My goal for the next decade
            is to solve the problem of the world using my engineering and
            programming skills, while making some money for myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last summer, I was doing full-stack development as a freelancer. The
            summer before that, I was fine-tuning large language models.
          </p>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m currently looking for opportunities in web dev, robotics, deep
            learning, and/or software engineering for Fall 2025. Feel free to
